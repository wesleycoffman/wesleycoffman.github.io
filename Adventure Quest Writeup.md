## Overview

Here I will document original work, research, and exploits done to manipulate the old flash game 'Adventure Quest' solely for fun. All exploits documented pose no danger but to give special abilities in-game. It is my duty to document these before Flash is banished from browsers starting in December of 2020. And with Flash, an era of Internet history is also banished.

## Scope

These exploits involve packet replay attacks via Burp Suite Proxy and local file mapping of tampered .swf files via Charles Proxy. Both cause a manipulation of the gaming engine to allow for excessive and unusual abilities in game, nothing more, nothing less. These meathods can be combined via a fancy double proxy to allow for best results. Game -> Charles -> Burp -> Game. Further areas to explore are the breaking of the client side D.I.Y. encryption used by the game developers. Fun stuff!
